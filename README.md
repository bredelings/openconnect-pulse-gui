### openconnect-nc-gui

This script provides a wrapper around [OpenConnect](https://www.infradead.org/openconnect/) which allows a user to log in through a WebKitGTK2 window.  This allows OpenConnect to be compatible with web-based authentication mechanisms, such as SAML.

## Requirements

The script requires the following packages:

    python >=3.3
    python-gi
    webkit2gtk
    openconnect

They can be installed with `pip -r requirements.txt`

## Installation

Installation can be performed using pip or directly calling `setup.py`.

## Usage

The only required required argument is the sign-in link / server URL.  Other arguments can be found by using `python openconnect-pulse-gui.py -h`.

Note that this script will not run openconnect, it will only print the command with the correct arguments to stdout.
